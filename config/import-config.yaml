# FEATURE FLAGS
# =============================================================================
#
# Available feature flags:
#
# feature_github_environment: Import GitHub repository environments
#   - When enabled, the importer fetches and includes environment configurations
#     (reviewers, wait timers, deployment branch policies, etc.) in generated YAML
#   - Environment secrets are NEVER imported
#   - Default: false
#   - This ensures existing repos managed in code won't be affected unless explicitly enabled
#

feature_github_environment: false
