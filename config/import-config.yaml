# =============================================================================
# FEATURE FLAGS
# =============================================================================
# All feature flags follow the pattern: feature_<feature_name> = true|false
# Feature flags control importer behavior and are read dynamically from this file.
# The same compiled binary works for all configurations - just update this file.
#
# Feature flags are disabled by default (false) to ensure backward compatibility
# and prevent unintended changes to existing repository configurations.
#
# Usage:
#   - For CLI: Both `import` and `bulk-import` commands read this file automatically
#   - For CI/CD: Simply commit changes to this file - no code changes needed
#   - Default config path: ./import-config.yaml
#   - Custom path: Use --config/-c flag: `go run main.go import owner/repo -c /path/to/config.yaml`
#
# Available feature flags:
#
# feature_github_environment: Import GitHub repository environments
#   - When enabled, the importer fetches and includes environment configurations
#     (reviewers, wait timers, deployment branch policies, etc.) in generated YAML
#   - Environment secrets are NEVER imported
#   - Default: false
#   - This ensures existing repos managed in code won't be affected unless explicitly enabled
#
#feature_github_environment: false
